SpyKids is a solution for parents to monitor children's locations using their mobile phones. Parents can view the current location, define safe or restricted zones where the child is by means of a circle or a polygon. 

The proposed solution uses an Android mobile application to be installed on the child's phone, but also on the parent's phone and a backend server developed using the SpringBoot framework. 
The solution uses a relational database to store user data.
